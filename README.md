# 💫 About Me:
I’m Jayden Hindley, a hands-on technologist who builds, runs, breaks, and rebuilds systems until they behave. My work lives at the intersection of infrastructure, automation, monitoring, AI experimentation, and web systems, with a strong bias toward self-hosting and understanding how things actually function under the hood.<br><br>I run a multi-server environment made up of physical machines and virtualised hosts, primarily using Linux, Proxmox, Docker, and GPU-accelerated workloads. I design systems with a DevOps mindset — if I build it, I’m responsible for keeping it alive. That means implementing proper backups, recovery strategies, monitoring, alerting, and security controls, not just making something work once and calling it done.<br><br>A large portion of my work has focused on custom monitoring and automation platforms. I’ve built dashboards that track server health, temperatures, uptime, login activity, and availability across both Windows and Linux systems, including high-performance lab machines. These systems pull data from logs, APIs, and hardware sensors, automate actions like Wake-on-LAN and service restarts, and present information in a way that’s immediately useful rather than overwhelming. Where commercial tools fell short or were too rigid, I built my own.<br><br>I’ve also developed automation tooling in Python, PowerShell, and Bash to remove repetitive manual work. This includes scheduled backup systems with full and incremental rotation, integrity checks, compression, and notifications; account and permission auditing; infrastructure health checks; and API-driven integrations with external services. The emphasis throughout has been reliability, clarity, and the ability to debug problems when things inevitably go wrong.<br><br>Alongside infrastructure, I actively experiment with AI and local model hosting, running models on self-hosted GPU servers rather than relying solely on cloud services. I’ve worked with local inference engines, model orchestration, and web interfaces, integrating AI into projects where it adds real value — from decision-making systems to simulation logic — rather than treating it as a novelty.<br><br>One of my more creative technical projects is an AI-driven city simulation, where an automated decision engine manages growth, economy, population, and events under defined constraints. The system blends rule-based logic with AI decision-making, visualised through a web interface, and is designed to surface interesting edge cases rather than produce perfect outcomes. It reflects my interest in complex systems, emergent behaviour, and making technical projects engaging and interactive.<br><br>I also maintain a personal portfolio and web presence, built and hosted by me, where I experiment with UI design, animations, and interactive elements while keeping the underlying code clean and maintainable. Design matters to me, but never at the expense of functionality.<br><br>Across everything I build, the common thread is curiosity and ownership. I care about why systems behave the way they do, how they fail, and how to design them so failure is recoverable rather than catastrophic. I document what I build, improve it over time, and treat every incident as a chance to make the system better than it was before.<br><br>Complex systems are fragile, fascinating, and deeply satisfying to tame — that’s the part of technology I enjoy most.
